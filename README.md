## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aimed to empower Amazon sellers with data-driven insights by analyzing product performance and customer sentiment. As a Junior Analyst at RetailTech Insights, I assessed product reviews and metadata to uncover actionable trends, supporting improvements in product development, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

### Data Source
The primary source of data usesd here is Amazon case study that can be freely downloaded from an open source such as Kaggle or FRED or any other data repository site

### Tools used
Microsoft Excel:
- Data cleaning
- Pivot table analysis
- Visualizations
- Dashboard creation

  ### Data Cleaning Process
- Removed duplicates and blank rows
- Split and transformed comma-separated values into structured columns
- Standardized formats for prices and percentages
- Created calculated columns for metrics like potential revenue, rating × review count, etc.
- Binned products into price ranges using conditional logic
